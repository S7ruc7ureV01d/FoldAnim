# ðŸ“± FoldAnim

Play animations on the external screen of a Galaxy Fold while using the main screen.  
**Root required**

---

## Overview
FoldAnim keeps the small outer display active even when the device is unfolded.  
It lets you play animations on the cover screen while using the main one.  
The app monitors the fold state and will stop the animation when folded and restart it when unfolded.  

### I only tested it on the first gen Galaxy Fold (SM-F900) with Android 12 stock OneUI ROM.
It should work on a GSI ROM too but I haven't tested this yet.

### I DO NOT recommend trying it on another model as it can potentially break the display configuration file.
If anyone has a newer Fold and wants to be a tester for a new version please hit me on Telegram @S7ruc7ureV01d
